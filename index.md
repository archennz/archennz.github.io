I am a second year graduate student at the University of California, San Diego. Here is my [CV]({{"files/cv_4.pdf"|absolute_url}}
).


I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. My undergraduate thesis was on spherical fusion categories supervised by [Corey Jones](https://www.coreyjonesmath.com/). You can read my thesis [here](https://tqft.net/web/research/students/AnRanChen/). 


My current academic interests are statistics and machine learning. 


For Spring 2020, I am the teaching assistant for MATH109-Mathematical Reasoning.
